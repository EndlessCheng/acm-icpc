Note<br />
The first testcase corresponds to the picture in the statement. To untangle the wires, one can first move the "plus" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the "minus" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses.

In the second testcase the "plus" wire makes one full revolution around the "minus" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled:

In the third testcase the "plus" wire simply runs above the "minus" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting "plus" and moving it higher:

In the fourth testcase the "minus" wire runs above the "plus" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:
